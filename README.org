* Overview
The Stock Prediction Program is a tool that uses historical stock data to predict future trends, using the Facebook Prophet library to generate forecasts based on a user-provided CSV file containing stock prices. The program offers an arsenal of tools for the user to work with when analyzing stock data. This software has been tested to work on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and Debian 12.

* Installation
** Install Dependencies
The Stock Predictor Program requires Qt 6.6, as well as, the pandas and prophet python packages.

Install the required python libraries using pip install:

#+begin_src shell
pip install pandas prophet
#+end_src

Install Qt 6.6.X using the online installer [[https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer-oss][here]].

** Build the program from source
Clone the Stock-Predictor-UI repository:
#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/ManuelAlbisu/Stock-Predictor-UI.git
#+end_src

Navigate to the root directory of the program:
#+begin_src shell
cd /path/to/Stock-Predictor-UI
#+end_src

Build the program:
#+begin_src shell
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
#+end_src

Run the program:
#+begin_src shell
./StockPredictor
#+end_src

** Build program through Qt Creator
Open Qt Creator and navigate to the *Welcome* tab. Select the *Open Project* button and navigate to the projects =CMakeLists.txt= file.

* Toolbar
[[file:images/toolbar.jpg]]

Similar to the menu bar, the tool bar give the user quick access to the *Open*, *Save*, and *Exit* actions. It also gives the user an easy way of toggling the lines plotted on the graph.

* Control Dock
[[file:images/control-dock.jpg]]

The control dock gives the user an easily accessible way of opening files, saving graphs with predictions, and exiting the program. A button for making predictions is also available for the user to interact with.

* Console
[[file:images/console.jpg]]

The console provides several methods of interacting with the data through commands.

Those commands include:
  - =list=: List all available commands.
  - =clear=: Clear the console.
  - =quit= | =exit= | =close=: Exit the program.
  - =current file=: Display the current file path.
  - =save <file_path>=: Save the current predictions to the specified file path.
  - =open <file_path>=: Open a CSV file from the specified path.
  - =make prediction <months>=: Make a prediction for the specified number of months (1-12).
  - =toggle <series>=: Toggle the visibility of the specified series (open, high, low, close, volume, line).
  - =seek <date>=: Seek and display the values for the specified date (format: yyyy-MM-dd).
  - =average <start_date> <end_date>=: Calculate the average values for the series in the specified date range (format: yyyy-MM-dd).

* Graph
[[file:images/graph.jpg]]

The graph is the main visualization method the UI uses for presenting stock data to the user. The individual lines on the graph can be toggled on and off so that the user can view the trajectory of a certain category.

Making a prediction will automatically draw a line on screen to separate the original data from the newly generated data.

* Predictions
[[file:images/graph-prediction.jpg]]

The user can predict stock trends by typing in the number of months into the future they would like to predict then pressing the *Make Prediction* button on the control panel.

The console also allows the user to make predictions simply by typing "make prediction <months>". A new graph with the predicted data appended to it will then be drawn on screen separated by a dotted line.

* Load
[[file:images/open-file-dialog.jpg]]

Selecting the load button will cause a dialog box to appear prompting the user to select a CSV file to display on the graph.

Files can also be opened by typing "open <file_path>" in the console.

* Save
[[file:images/save-file-dialog.jpg]]

[[file:images/file-saved.jpg]]

Selecting the *Save* button will open a dialog box and prompts the user to select a directory to save the file in. The user can give the file and name and the file will be saved.

Only files which have had predictions performed on them can be saved. Files can also be saved using the console by typing "save <file_path>".
